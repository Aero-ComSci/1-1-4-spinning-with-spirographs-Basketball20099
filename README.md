Zero Iteration and Infinite loop:
The zero iteration basically has a set variable, and then a while loop for a different answer. It is set at input = "no" and then the while loop only goes for answer == "yes". The infinite loop has the answer set at no, but then there is a user input, where the user can answer yes to the question, and then the loop will have it set to infinitely print what I set it to print.

8. It represents an infinite loop, since it is always set at answer =="y". The code will always run the loop.
